// Plugin management is a *replacement*, not a layer: the shell renders it
// instead of the home hero / session transcript, while the rail stays live on
// its left. That makes the rail the only way back, so every conversation
// navigation — a session link, 「新建任务」, a session the composer just created
// — has to leave the plugin surface. It used to be a bare `useState(false)`
// that only the plugin page's own × button cleared, so a rail click changed
// the selected session invisibly and the user stayed on the marketplace with
// no apparent response.
//
// The rule lives here rather than in the component so it is testable without a
// DOM (see `packages/webui/AGENTS.md` — no jsdom in this package): the shell
// funnels every session change through one setter, and that setter dispatches
// `show-conversation`.
